# Manually Decipher Text Encoded with ASCII Values

## Understanding the Encoding Scheme
Each letter is represented by its ASCII value in a three-digit format. For example:
- **A** = **065**
- **B** = **066**
- **Space** = **032**

## Encoding the Example Message
Let's take the example message: **"This is an example"**. 
First, convert each character to its ASCII value:
- **T** = **084**
- **h** = **104**
- **i** = **105**
- **s** = **115**
- (space) = **032**
- **i** = **105**
- **s** = **115**
- (space) = **032**
- **a** = **097**
- **n** = **110**
- (space) = **032**
- **e** = **101**
- **x** = **120**
- **a** = **097**
- **m** = **109**
- **p** = **112**
- **l** = **108**
- **e** = **101**

The encoded message will be:
- **084104105115032105115032097110032101120097109112108101**

## Splitting the Encoded Message
Take the entire encoded string and break it into groups of three digits. For example, from your encoded text:
- **042073032042106032042109032042074032...**

This results in:
- **042 073 032 042 106 032 042 109 032 042 074 032...**

## Converting Each Group to a Character
For each three-digit number, convert it to its corresponding ASCII character. Use the ASCII table or a conversion tool:
- **042** -> **\***
- **073** -> **I**
- **032** -> (space)
- **106** -> **j**
- **109** -> **m**
- **074** -> **J**
- **...** and so on for the rest of the groups.

## Reassembling the Decoded Message
As you convert each three-digit group, write down the corresponding characters to form a sentence. Continuing from the example:
- **042 -> \***
- **073 -> I**
- **032 -> (space)**
- **106 -> j**
- **032 -> (space)**
- **109 -> m**
- **...**

This results in an intermediate string like:
- **"* I j * m ..."**

## Cleaning Up the Decoded Message
Remove any unwanted characters (like the **\*** if it is used as a placeholder) and adjust spacing as necessary. The final step involves reading through the assembled characters and interpreting them contextually. Ensure that any extra spaces or symbols that do not contribute to the message are deleted.

## Example: Full Decoding Process
Given the encoded text:
- **042073032042106032...**

After splitting:
- **042 073 032 106 ...**

Convert each group to characters:
- **I (space) j ...**

Final result after cleaning:
- **"I j ..."**

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can manually decipher the encoded message into readable text. The key is to understand the format (three-digit ASCII values) and methodically convert each segment back to its corresponding character.
